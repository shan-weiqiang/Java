Demonstrate use of anonymous class in Java.

## Anonymous classes are kinds of `inner classe`
First of all: anonymous class in Java is a spectial kind of `inner class`, non-static nested class. It has characteristics of `inner class`, with following features:
- Can't define any anonymous class constructors, because it's anonymous
- Can only `extend` ONE class or `implement` ONE interface, but not with multi and not at the same time. 

The anonymous classes are mainly used to convinently override some method of a class or implment some method of a interface, without declare a class.


Three kinds of anonymous classes:

- Anonymous Inner class that extends a class
- Anonymous Inner class that implements an interface
- Anonymous Inner class that defines inside method/constructor argument
